bayes theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation
where a and b are events and are the probabilities
the real chance of having the event here the equation
and here the decoder key to read it chance of
of any positive result we can simplify the equation to
is a normalizing constant and helps scale our equation without
probability of the data conditional on the hypothesis bayes theorem
in an unfortunate but now unavoidable choice of terminology statisticians
then we will look at the notation and terminology involved
in this formula t stands for a theory or hypothesis
lending money to potential borrowers the formula is as follows
also called bayes rule
deck bayes theorem formula the formula is written as
are the probabilities of a and b without regard to
bayes theorem to estimate this new probability the formula is
is the probability of a occurring and is called the
they show us how to update our knowledge bayes formula
example suppose math has two section in section there is
the probability of the hypothesis after getting the evidence is
many modern machine learning techniques rely on bayes theorem for
in these instances and so the expressions simplify bayes theorem
while this is an equation that applies to any probability
evidence in this case the formula can be written as
this relates the probability of the hypothesis before getting the
then the posterior probability can be calculated using bayes theorem
since every king is also a face card since there
first is computed using the simpler version of bayes theorem
to find we must determine the prior probability that the
boy this is equal to therefore the desired probability is
for a similarly paradoxical problem see the monty hall problem
event that both children are boys we want to find
we can easily see that we also note that and
true got that the basic mathematical formula takes this form
with p standing for probability b for belief and e
has already occurred the following formula was provided for finding
in addition to the above formal rule the textbook also
event a given that event b has subsequently occurred is
that a formidable expression but we will simplify its calculation
c in place of b we get the following result
before we knew that the survey subject smoked a cigar
selection of elts from the three manufacturers a b c
intuitive bayes theorem now let find by using a table
but by symmetry we can also get it follows that
which is the so called bayes rule it is common
hence we can state bayes rule in another way as
see an example of bayes theorem
this is actually what bayes theorem is about
most often however the theorem appears in a somewhat different
often however the theorem appears in a somewhat different form
where b is an event complementary to b the universal
and exhaustive events events that satisfy bayes theorem states that
where the sum is taken over all i we shall
any event from the same sample space such that then
note invoking the fact that bayes theorem can also be
the fact that bayes theorem can also be expressed as
unless you are a world class statistician bayes theorem as
